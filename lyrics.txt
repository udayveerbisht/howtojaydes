		these cuts on my wrist they ripe i swear

cause they sometimes make me better

dying just to see you again

guess i’m tired of writing letters to you

can’t express myself, i always choke on my own words

can’t explain what’s going on, all i know is that it hurts
i can’t do this no more without you

baby you’re my rose, without you+

regret, all i cared and loved you

i’ve thought that i’ve grown, but now i get it

lost the only thing i loved

completely was my fault

myself i can’t keep safe
you know it’s all my fault because you didn’t have a say in it

i f+cked everything up, but i’m just so tired of saying it

hearing me you’d be disappointed, but i can’t sing to no one else

and i swear i’m just so tired that i might just k!ll myself

i did my time, i’m ready to leave here (the mock of the year sits on a table)

then again, i could be right, enough for me to stay (decorated by the paintings of the youthful)

the karma takes its toll (elation takes its hold)

i guess i’m lame and old , i’m tired of a few things (and i feel it for the first time)

i wonder what that’s like

i wanna go, where it snows

where you treat me, that’s all i know

you’re my soul, and that’s just so

i’m so cold, so f+cking cold

you wanna call me, how can i hear you?

you’re so foreign, i just wanna feel you

rockin’ my head so i can’t help but fear you

i see your headlights, they flash to the rearview
[verse 2: jaydes]

you said you changed then got worse

you looked me in the eyes and said

i swear you never meant any of it

you just liked the way i looked when i believed it

i never met anyone so forеign

(never met anyonе so foreign)

you said the same sh+t every time

i’ll be your poison

falling deep in your poison

		[chorus]

spendin’ all my nights alone, waitin’ for you to call me

you’re the only one i want by my side when i fall asleep

tell me what you waitin’ for, tell me what you waitin’ for

i know it’s hard but we need each other

know it’s hard but we need each other
[verse]

i have these little things up in my brain i need some help with

i can’t keep getting off with being selfish

can never get a break ’cause sometimes i’m too selfless

i can’t bear to be evil at this point

and it feel likes these days, my hеaven is your greatest hеll

and it feels like you’re the only one, that i could tell, all my problems to

so yeah i really don’t hope you do, anything stupid to yourself

i swear [?]

you made me feel like i was in heaven, and you were helping, and you’re gone

and you’re gone

you’re gone, you’re gone

you’re gone, you’re gone
[chorus]

spendin’ all my nights alone, waitin’ for you to call me

you’re the only one i want by my side when i fall asleep

tell me what you waitin’ for, tell me what you waitin’ for

i know it’s hard but we need each other

know it’s hard but we need each other

we just slid to brooklyn, uber we was too geeked

b+tch, i’m tryna see you, don’t know what you did to me

bae don’t ask no questions, don’t worry about her

n+ggas showin’ true colors, gas gettin’ louder

backwoods got me back to normal

can’t make me jealous, just viewed as a ho now, hey

“i see you selling out shows now, jay”

all of that money, you still not okay

still feelin’ alone, twin in that scat, you know what we on

like, what’s in this pack ? like, what’s in this pack?

i’m smoking on strong, like, bae, where you at?

[verse: babyxsosa]

i pull up to brooklyn, uber l was too thick

i don’t ask no questions, send me the location

walk up, i see my bro

in pink pants with no hoe

all these n+ggas on the block

i say marco, you say polo

before i even touch down

had to knock a b+tch right ’round

i’m with surf gang right now

we don’t do no questions now

i say “marco”, you say “polo”

i’m with surf gang now

		so everyone knows who we are
stand with my hand to the sky

so high i just want to fly

i’m loving life i’ll be fine

just past the light and everything will be alright

stay out all night still alive never die i will survive

live on in my songs you can find me in a rhyme

long after i’m gone be strong

prove um wrong and keep moving on

ain’t n0body gonna hold me down

spit these rounds hit each sound

you ain’t ever heard it like this before

flip the script while i rip the show

let everybody know

with my semi auto flow

push the pedal to the metal

while i bang this instrumental

i’m not saying that we’re better

just on another level

to the top to be the best

and never settle for less

won’t stop, not for nothing

i’m finally good for something

besides busting

you can find me hustling

reaching for stars

bout to blow

see how far we go

on the microphone

rhyming on a roll

it’s time everybody knows who we are

everybody knows what a star looks like

when it falls from the sky in the dark of the night

if you’re lost just follow the light

always shine bright anywhere we go

so everyone knows
shooting stars

aiming for the moon

that’s who we are

rise above it all

like shooting stars

aiming for the moon

that’s who we are

rise above it all
need a key the way that we lock floor

a key a week at least say no more

key phrases you got to know

flow till a mother f++++++ hits the flo

better rip it slow

cuz you know i won’t

i go for broke

i don’t just joke

i hold my own i sold um ___

i, i, i know i smoke

i, i, i know i’m dope

i, i, i’m more than dope

i wrote my life in more than notes

in hopes one day everyone knows

so here i go

there i am

me and o’sam

with a master plan

let me see your hands

don’t just sit there understand that

everybody knows what a star looks like

when it falls from the sky in the dark of the night

if you’re lost just follow the light

always shine bright anywhere we go

so everyone knows who we are
everybody knows

so everyone knows who we are

everybody knows

so everyone knows who we are
shooting stars

aiming for the moon

that’s who we are

aiming for the moon

i wanna clip ’em in the back of the head

man, i can’t stand being around you

you look so silly when you’re getting out your car

i’m around and lurking ran into right where you are

skipping ’round the parking lot, you almost ran into a car

wish you could see, but you’re terrified of me

so i kept on looking, scratching on the pack of 100’s

i still know where you live and you know i still haunt it

for you, must be crazy, you don’t know how bad i want it

hold my breath until my skin turns baby blue (baby blue)

we got so carried away (we got so carried away), we got so carried away

alone again, you’re rotting in your room (rotting in your room)

what else is there to do?

i’m leaving without you (i’m leaving without you)

i’ve seen every shade of blue (i’ve seen every shade of blue)

i’m l+sting for you

you’re something for me

shut myself in the dark, away from you

and yet you still adore me

i looked in your eyes, it’s easy to leave the truth

always pushing the blame

but why would i lie to you?

it probably won’t be the same when i’m inside of you

i think i wanna die, i have nothing to lose

i don’t want you to cry but i wanna see it through

i look at all your eyes and look away right after

in my head i hear laughter

i know you know (i know you know)

you’re wasting my time (you’re wasting my time)

i know you know

you’re wasting my time

it makes my head ache

burn that hoe, my lil thot

she’s so bad cut, can’t come from

there’s blood red, a new blood red

light up and go run around

she run her mouth, she never stop

she sending voicemails through my phone

she wanna go, but she can’t go
[chorus]

but she can’t go, girl

girl, i’m tappin your window, will you let me in

it felt like losing control, you so d+mn hurt love within

you don’t know where your going, but i know where ur going

make me talk to your walls

i just hope they get along

i’d still hear you if you said my name wrong

she was my retribution

the body’s decomposing

she scratched me on my shoulder

but i told her we’re fine

everything’s so pointless

everyone’s a loser

you need to hear it

when you’re in need of your own life

[verse 2]

my retribution’s gone, she’s just another blonde

her cold and lifeless body, was supposed to move on

maybe i’m just joking, but maybe i’m not kidding

i’d love to play pretend, but all the kidding me is gone

oh, there’s no sirens

n0body’s gonna hеar it when you scream

oh, it’s so quiet

[intro: jaydes]

(—made this one)

grown ass man tryna clown me for being born in ’06 yet i still have more money than you, n+gga, you clowning me for being young, bro, what the f+ck wrong with you?
[verse 1: jaydes]

i’m in mexico with dro, smoking on this dope

‘net bangers, talking h+lla sh+t until we kick the doors

question that, how you got them ties? b+tch, i’m from the 4

we gon’ junk his spot and take the bands, then we finna roll

n+gga talking crazy, you my lil’ bro, better chill out

five [.40s?] mixed with forty+nine gon’ bring the [thrill?] out

two thousand mixed with ’06 gon’ bring a [lil’ drought?]

n+ggas hit me up from elementary for a lil’ clout

keep singing, b+tch, you know all the words, b+tch, i know you know me

i heard you flagging, now you gon’ die, obi wan ken0bi

checking all my pockets, full of green, f+cking guacamole

n+ggas asking, “how the f+ck you evvls if your flow so holy?”

you want smoke? we could meet at regal if you bring a camera

flash, flash, boom, pow, that’s the end of your lil’ era (oh sh+t!)

[you was in my comments like some paper?], all my n+ggas tear ’em

seen him in the streets, take his clothes, all my n+ggas wear ’em

[verse 2: tae retro]

wait, i think i understand it

why this n+gga bragging ’bout his ho, he need higher standards

when i drop a track, they run it back, i’m barry sanders

you can’t cross me like ai because i’m the answer

n+gga with attitude, i’m really ruthless like eazy e

she ain’t much, but the head decent, she pleasing me

really apply force in the field, ain’t no creasing me

in the booth, i really lose control, no decency

evvls really evil in the booth, i’m rather holy

sorry, bro, ain’t know that was your ho, n0body told me

n+ggas acting weird, that’s why i prefer to be by my lonely

i’ll bend backwards for the paper, you’ll never fold me

if it ain’t ’bout the money, i can’t hear it, let’s keep it cordial

n+gga tried to battle with a god, he a mere mortal

always stay different from the rest, i’m never normal

k!lling beats, grab the suit and tie, let’s make it formal
